  Senior Software Development Engineer in Test with 14+ years of experience designing and evolving quality platforms, automation frameworks, and cross-platform testing solutions for large-scale web, mobile, desktop, and API-driven products, including consumer-facing fintech platforms.

  I operate at the intersection of quality, architecture, and delivery, working across multiple product teams (web, mobile, backend) to define testing strategy, build reusable frameworks, and embed quality gates into CI/CD pipelines to support fast, safe releases at scale.

  I have deep hands-on experience with mobile platforms, including both testing and development of Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) applications, and building automation and tooling around shared cross-platform architectures.
